Project involved designing and developing an interactive HR Attrition Dashboard using Power BI to provide deep insights into employee attrition trends and factors. The dashboard helps HR teams and management make data-driven decisions to reduce turnover and improve employee retention.

**Key features and tasks:**

**Data Sources:** Integrated multiple data sources, including employee records, performance reviews, compensation data, and exit interview feedback.
**ETL Process: **Cleaned and transformed raw HR data using Power Query and SQL for seamless analysis.
**Data Modeling:** Created a robust data model using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key metrics such as attrition rate, department-wise attrition, tenure, and demographic analysis.
**Visualizations: ** Developed dynamic visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, slicers, and donut to represent:
Employee attrition by department, age, gender, and job role
Attrition trends over time (monthly/quarterly)
Key reasons for employee exits based on surveys

**KPI's :**
1. Total Attrition
2. Attrition Rate
3. Attrition by education/Age (Male/Female)
4. Average Age
5. Average Salary
6. Average Year in Company
